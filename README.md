# Machine-Learning-Framework-from-Scratch

## Project Overview

This project is to develop a complete machine learning framework that mimics the algoritms of well-known open-source flatform, Tensorflow.
This project can be separated into 2 parts: 1) Machine Learning Algorithms 2) Basic Neural Networks

## Machine Learning Algoritms

You can solve classification problems by using several different kinds of machine learning algorithms such as linear regression and SVM in this project.
Those are basically for classification problems (it is highly recommended not to use them for regression problems), especially focused on to the iris-dataset.
This projects not only supports well known binary classifier algorithms but also multi-classifiers such as OvR classifier and Random Forest.

## Neural Networks

You can generate a simple neural network by using this project to solve classification problems by using neural network.
It supports several well known optimization solutions and initialization options that makes the network useful.
Even though this project does not support CNN, but it has proven to perform well for MNIST datasets.

## Testbench Files

This project includes some testbench files for each machine learning algorithms.
Those are the files with its name starting with 'testbench'.
